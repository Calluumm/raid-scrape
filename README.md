Requires a feed from an external database to aptly update,

Ideally ran at gambit reset daily; Infographic design to be worked on

Further.py to be used in conjunction with the database for more graphing functions, could very easily turn that into a central file with a seperate graph functions file however I've done it now and I'm lazy.

Raid time scraping takes just the "model.raid.historicRaids" field from the wynntils user data file, turns it into a csv saving times of raids to be processed elsewhere; ran on fpm without dependancies in the toml
